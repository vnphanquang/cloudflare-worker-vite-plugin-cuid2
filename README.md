## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
3. Run the development server with `pnpm dev`.
4. Go to `http://localhost:5173`, verify that `cuid2` works as expected.
5. Build the project with `pnpm build`.
6. Run build in Cloudflare workerd environment with `pnpm wrangler dev`.
7. Observe output in terminal

### Expected Result

### Actual Output

Server fails to start with the following error:

```log
âœ˜ [ERROR] service core:user:cloudflare-vite-get-started: Uncaught Error: Disallowed operation called within global scope. Asynchronous I/O (ex: fetch() or connect()), setting a timeout, and generating random values are not allowed within global scope. To fix this error, perform this operation within a handler. https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/
